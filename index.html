		<h1 class="first">Welcome To My Mozambican Website!!</h1>
		<p>In here i will be showing and most importantly talking about my country in the most brief way possible for those who are clueless about it.</p>
		<p>The 1<small>st</small> reason i am doing it, is very much personal i would say, once i am studying abroad i have been questioned several times by a lot of people about my country. So instead of just keep trying to reply everybody i thought maybe the idea of creating my 1<small>st</small> website talking about it, would save me a bit of time in the sence that i would request some people to visit it.</p>
		 <p>The 2<small>nd</small> reason and the last i would love to mention is that i am endeavouring on becoming a great Web Developer one day.</p>
		<p>So, first and foremost i will start by answering the most asked questions, further more i will be showing some pictures of my country... Thanks!</p>
